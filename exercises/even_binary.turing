; read the first symbol, go to q1 and move right.
q0 1 1 r q1

; keep moving right until encountering a _ symbol.
q1 1 1 r q1
q1 0 0 r q1
q1 _ _ l q2

; read the last symbol in the binary number and change state accordingly.
q2 1 1 r q_false
q2 0 0 r q_true

; write Y after the number if the number is even and N if it is not.
q_false _ N * halt
q_true _ Y * halt
