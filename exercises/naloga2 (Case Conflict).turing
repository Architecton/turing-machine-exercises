;Turing program that accepts language of the form L = {a^i*b^i | i >= 0}

; move right to the first b symbol
q0 a a r q0
q0 0 0 r q0

; change the first b symbol to a 0, change state to q1 and go left until
; encountering first a
q0 b 0 l q1
q1 0 0 l q1
; when encountering first a, go to state q0 and repeat the process
q1 a 0 r q0

; if there are no more b symbols, go to state q2 and go back on 0's
q0 _ _ l q2
q2 0 0 l q2

; if all input was changed to 0's, halt
q2 _ _ * halt
